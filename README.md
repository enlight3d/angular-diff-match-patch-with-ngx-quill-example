# angular-diff-match-patch-with-ngx-quill-example

I made this example because I was searching for an Angular 11+ implementation of Google's diff-match-patch library and a possibility to apply it to text formatted from a rich text editor.

I used Quill for the editor and I used code from this project to make it work properly : https://codepen.io/amweiss/pen/grXNPm
